# Ransomware 

This repository provides a set of didactic scripts designed for educational purposes to help understand the different phases of ransomware attacks. It covers the following phases:

**Deployment**: The initial stage where the attacker infiltrates the target system.

**Installation**: The process by which the ransomware establishes persistence on the compromised machine.

**Control**: Managing the ransomware's activities and maintaining access to the system.

**Encryption**: Executing the encryption process on the victim's files, rendering them inaccessible.

**Extortion**: The final stage where the attacker demands a ransom for decrypting the files and restoring access to the victim.

**Usage**

Each phase is explained in detail, and corresponding scripts are provided in the repository for practical exploration. It's important to note that these scripts are for educational purposes only and should never be used for any malicious activities.


Before you begin, ensure you have the necessary environment set up. You may need specific software, libraries, or configurations to run these scripts. Please refer to the individual phase folders for specific requirements.
